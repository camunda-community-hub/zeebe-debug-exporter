/**
 * Record consumers receive a deserialized records and must return their greatest known acknowledged
 * position. Consumers are guaranteed to receive records in order w.r.t to their partition - that
 * is, all records for a given partition X will be received in sorted by position, ascending. Note
 * however that a consumer may receive records from multiple partitions, and records between
 * partitions are not ordered.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: as Zeebe exporters use at-least-once semantics, it's possible to receive duplicates.
 * Note however that each sequence is still sorted w.r.t to the partition. This means that while a
 * single sequence will always be increasing and sorted, a new sequence may restart at a previously
 * seen position. However, that sequence will then be increasing and sorted. It's not possible to
 * receive a sequence such as: {@code 1, 9, 2, -1, 3, 0, 10}, but it is possible to receive {@code
 * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Consumers are expected to perform deduplication.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: when acknowledging with a given position, if a higher position was already recorded by
 * the Zeebe broker for that partition, the new position returned here will simply be ignored.
